# cli_chat
This is a simple CLI ChatGPT like assistant

This application is created using OpenAI API and Python.

# Description:
This application is a CLI chatbot that uses OpenAI API (GPT-3.5-turbo or GPT-4) to generate responses.

It facilitates developer experience by allowing developers to chat with the chatbot directly from the terminal.

I (personally) highly recommend using this application in VSCode's, JetBrain's or some IDE integrated terminal.
